1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,785
In this video we will run through our Gnome's Well development

2
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:11,571
First we will test the game and

3
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:17,357
We will play Gnome's well using our mobile phone.

4
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:23,143
Now where on the Main menu of the game, let's start by pressing new game.

5
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:28,929
As you can see the game is hard, and the Gnome dies when it hits a trap

6
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:34,715
For winning simulation we will make the Gnome invisible so we can demonstrate it without consuming more time.

7
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:40,501
Now, we will go to the architecture and main components of the game.

8
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:46,287
we will focus to our hierarchy pane.

9
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:52,073
Let's see first the Main Menu scene

10
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:57,859
take a look the hierarchy pane.

11
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:03,645
Here we have the menu scene

12
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:09,431
Main camera for this scene

13
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:15,217
Canvas where the image and button stored

14
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:21,003
MainMenu

15
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:26,789
and the Event System

16
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:32,575
Now let's take a look on Main Scene

17
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:38,361
Here we have the MainScene

18
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:44,147
Main Camera

19
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:49,933
Rope

20
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:55,719
Input Manager

21
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:01,505
Canvas

22
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:07,291
EventSystem

23
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:13,077
Game Manager

24
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:18,863
Start point

25
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:24,649
TreasurePresent

26
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:30,435
Background

27
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:36,221
Level

28
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:42,007
Rope hightlights

29
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:47,793
Our First coding will be the rope script where the rope physics happen

30
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:53,579
let's open the rope script by clicking the rope script

31
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:59,365
from the scripts folder in asset

32
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:05,151
This is our code for the rope

33
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:10,937
We will see a public class for the rope and declare the ropeSegmentPrefab to use

34
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:16,723
Here we will see the code for extending and retracting the rope

35
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:22,509
In start function we will cache the linereder and

36
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:28,295
we will call the ResetLength function

37
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:34,081
This is the ResetLength function

38
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:39,867
In CreateRopeSegments, this is where the rope segments created when we extend our rope

39
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:45,653
Next is the RemoveRopeSegment, called when rope is retracting

40
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:51,439
Next is the Update, it update every frame when

41
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:57,224
the rope is extending or retracting

42
00:03:57,224 --> 00:04:03,010
this is the condition if we extend the rope

43
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,796
this is the condition if the rope retracts

44
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:14,582
Another highlights of coding is the bodypart

45
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:20,368
Let's see what it does

46
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:26,154
Here we have the code for the damage type when gnome hits trap

47
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:31,940
Slicing and Burning

48
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,726
Next is the DestroyGame function where when the gnome receive

49
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:43,512
damage it will end the game

50
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:49,298
UI, this is our main menu

51
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:55,084
It has the new game button to start the game

52
00:04:55,084 --> 00:05:00,870
Next is the actual game UI

53
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,656
First we have the invicible checkbox at the upper left of the screen

54
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:12,442
to make the gnome invincible from the traps

55
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:18,228
at the upper right of the screen we can find the pause button

56
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:24,014
to pause the game and contains resume and new game button

57
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:29,800
at the lower right corner of the screen we can find the

58
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,586
up and down button to control the rope

59
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:41,372
So we're here at the project files directory

60
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:47,158
Let's take a look around on the asset folder

61
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:52,944
Gnome, Level, Scenes, Scripts, Sounds, and Sprites

62
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:58,730
this are the important components to build the game

63
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:04,516
Let's open the Gnome folder

64
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:10,302
Here we can find the prefabs and materials we use in developing the

65
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:16,088
game

66
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:21,874
next is Level

67
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:27,660
where all the level components like traps stored

68
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,446
Next is Scenes, where all scene of the game stored

69
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:39,232
Next is Scripts, where the script files of the game is stored

70
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:45,018
Next is Sounds, where all the sound effects used is stored

71
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:50,804
Next is Sprites, where all the sprites used is stored

72
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:56,590
Example is the parts of prototype Gnome we

73
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:02,376
assembled earlier is stored here

74
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:08,162
To build and run the game we will go to the file menu

75
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:13,948
and click build and run

76
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:19,734
It will ask to select a folder then after that click select folder

77
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:25,520
To run the game you will need to locate your build file

78
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,306
copy the apk file to your device and install it the it's ready to go

79
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:37,092
The only known issue we found is that the body parts of the Gnome

80
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:42,878
stays in the level even if the Gnome dies multiple times

81
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:48,664
Letting the Gnome's bodypart stay for couple of

82
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:54,449
seconds and vanish could be a possible improvements
