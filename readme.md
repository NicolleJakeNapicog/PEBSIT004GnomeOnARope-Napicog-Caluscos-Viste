# Gnome’s Well

A 2D game prototype where a gnome character interacts with rope-based physics using Unity’s Rigidbody2D, HingeJoint2D, and other components.

## Engine / Language / Version
- Unity (2D Project)  6000.2.2f1
- C# (for scripts)

## Controls
- Keyboard (default Unity input handling)  
(Specify keys if customized — e.g., arrow keys for movement, space for jump)

## How to Run
Exact steps to open/build/run (e.g., “Open Unity Hub → Add project → Open scene X → Press Play” or make build & ./run.sh) 

## Known Issues / Limitations
- Rope physics may behave unpredictably due to hinge and spring joint constraints.  
- Limited to Unity Editor testing (no build instructions provided).  

## Video Demo
- Link to video () and location of SRT file
- Subtitles: demo.srt (located in project folder)
